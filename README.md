# WebCamJS-Test
This is a web-app which i used to learn how to interact with a webcamera using JS.
To achive this I used image prossesing to process the camera stream to work as a motiondetector.
I later used this to create a little game in the same spirit as Eye-Toy. 

## running
To run it i used live server in VS-code but do as you usally do when running a html/js project.

### Futher implementations
Adding more games and cleaning up the code would be nice... (its a mess right now);
